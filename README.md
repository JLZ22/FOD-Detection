## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn install`:

```bash
yarn tauri dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
